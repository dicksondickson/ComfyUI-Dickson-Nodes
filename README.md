# Dickson's ComfyUI Custom Nodes Collection  

This is a set of custom nodes that I've either written myself or adapted from other authors for my own convenience.  


# Changelog  
v1.0.7 - Change node names to not conflict with TTPLANET.  
v1.0.6 - Add image info output to imageload node.   
v1.0.5 - Added ImageLoad node - provides filename and image width and height as integer.  
v1.0.4 - ColorMatch node is now 15x to 17x faster.   
v1.0.0 - Release.   



# Nodes

**TTPlanet controlnet tile preprocessor node**  
Forked from [https://huggingface.co/TTPlanet/TTPLanet_SDXL_Controlnet_Tile_Realistic](https://huggingface.co/TTPlanet/TTPLanet_SDXL_Controlnet_Tile_Realistic) for my own convienence.
TTPlanet's Controlnet model is meant to be used with this node which you can download on his Huggingface repo.
