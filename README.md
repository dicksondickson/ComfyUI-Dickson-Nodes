# Dickson's ComfyUI Custom Nodes Collection  

This is a set of custom nodes that I've either written myself or adapted from other authors for my own convenience.  


# Changelog
7-9-2024: Colormatch node is now 10x faster.

**TTPlanet controlnet tile preprocessor node**  
Forked from [https://huggingface.co/TTPlanet/TTPLanet_SDXL_Controlnet_Tile_Realistic](https://huggingface.co/TTPlanet/TTPLanet_SDXL_Controlnet_Tile_Realistic) for my own convienence.
TTPlanet's Controlnet model is meant to be used with this node which you can download on his Huggingface repo.
